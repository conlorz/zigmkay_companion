# Executable preview releases

Preview packaging targets macOS 15 on Apple Silicon and Intel, Windows 11 on
x86_64, and glibc Linux on x86_64 (Ubuntu 22.04 / glibc 2.35 baseline). Users do
not need Zig. Every download contains Zig 0.17.0, its library tree, immutable
firmware packages, native runner sources and flash tools. Missing resources fail
locally; firmware builds use the bundled compiler with `--system` and do not
download replacements. Linux uses AppImage rather than a sandboxed Flatpak;
Flatpak device and USB-portal integration remains future work.

These are unsigned previews. Read the [download notes](../packaging/preview-notes.md)
for OS launch restrictions. No release has been published merely by adding this
workflow. Current evidence is local Apple Silicon packaging, offline firmware
and runner checks; the other native release lanes must pass in CI before release.

## Building and packaging

Use exactly Zig 0.17.0. On the native host:

```sh
zig build bundle-application build-bundle-check build-release-tools \
  -Dapplication-bundle=true -Ddesktop-dependencies=true -Ddesktop-vectors=true \
  -Drelease=true -Doptimize=safe -Drevision="$(git rev-parse HEAD)" -j2
```

On macOS also pass `-Dmacos-sdk="$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)"`. The release graph
uses baseline CPUs and explicit minimum OS versions, including the native flash
helpers. The installed layouts are `zig-out/Zigmkay.app`, `zig-out/Zigmkay.exe`
and `zig-out/Zigmkay.AppDir`. Linux's Zig `AppRun` resolves the application and
libraries from its own location; the application resolves resources from its
executable. User projects, SQLite history, exports and compiler caches stay in
the existing platform user-storage locations, outside the installation/mount.

Run `zig-out/bin/release package ABSOLUTE_PACKAGE_PATH ABSOLUTE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
SOURCE_COMMIT` to create the DMG, portable EXE or AppImage. Windows uses
`release.exe`. Packaging is a developer/CI operation and may acquire pinned
packaging tools and corresponding sources. The installed application never does.
AppImage inputs use [immutable asset IDs and SHA-256 pins](../packaging/appimage-pins.zon);
the runtime is supplied with `--runtime-file`, avoiding appimagetool's default
latest-runtime download. Tool pins must be reviewed together with their sources.

Linux packaging requires Ubuntu 22.04 build libraries, `readelf`, `ldd`, `curl`,
`tar`, `xkb-data`, and enabled `deb-src` package indexes. It inspects every shipped
ELF executable/shared library, including Zig and helpers; bundles non-baseline
dependencies and SDL native backends, XKB data and library notices; and rejects
GLIBC requirements above 2.35. glibc, its loader and graphics-driver libraries
remain system-provided. Exact installed source package versions are downloaded
into the corresponding-source directory. macOS rejects non-system dynamic
dependencies. Windows inspects ordinary and delay-loaded PE imports for every
shipped executable and DLL against the Windows system-library allowlist.

The DMG contains the application and an Applications shortcut. Application
metadata records version, source revision, architecture and minimum OS. Build
resources have a bundle identity and tool hashes; per-asset JSON adds supported
database, record, timing, metric and generator versions. Package hashes are
computed after packaging. Future signing must reseal hashes of nested executables;
the Windows payload reader currently expects its footer at EOF, so appending an
Authenticode signature requires a reader change before signing.

## Linux launch and device permissions

Use `chmod +x Zigmkay-*.AppImage`, then launch the file. The modern static runtime
does not need a separate libfuse2 package. If the kernel cannot mount FUSE:

```sh
./Zigmkay-*.AppImage --appimage-extract
./squashfs-root/AppRun
```

Both forms use the same persistent user-data directories. Keep the extracted
directory intact. Neither form installs system rules automatically. To allow a
local logged-in user to access the companion HID interface (FAFA:00F0) and RP2040
ROM BOOTSEL USB interface (2E8A:0003), inspect and install the narrowly scoped
[udev rules](../packaging/linux/70-zigmkay.rules):

```sh
sudo install -m 0644 squashfs-root/usr/share/zigmkay/70-zigmkay.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/70-zigmkay.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

Reconnect the keyboard after reloading. The `uaccess` rules grant an active local
session access; remote/headless users need an administrator's explicit device
access policy. Linux and macOS retain picotool. Windows uses its built-in BOOTSEL
mass-storage driver and the bundled Zig transfer helper, with no WinUSB setup.
It rejects multiple matching devices, verifies USB ancestry plus `INFO_UF2.TXT`,
revalidates GUID/serial/disk/USB identity, checks frozen UF2 bytes and hash, and
writes directly to a GUID-qualified destination. Cancellation stops and joins
the helper; discovery and transfer are bounded, with no automatic retry. Copying
completes the transfer; only the existing coherent live firmware handshake
completes flashing. There is no mass-storage byte-for-byte flash read-back.
Version-1 tool and bundle descriptors continue to use picotool; version 2 records
the backend and the executable hashes (the wrapper hash identifies the helper).

## History upgrades and rollback

The schema stays at **3**. Schemas 1–3 and legacy ZON histories are supported.
Record, timing, metric and generator versions remain independent; incompatible
payload changes require explicit version changes. Newer schemas, foreign
application IDs and unsupported payloads report storage errors without resetting
or replacing history. Other editor features remain available.

An upgrade reserves the SQLite writer, rechecks the version, and uses a separate
read connection with SQLite's online backup API. This includes committed WAL
pages. A synced backup is atomically published exclusively under persistent
`typing-practice/backups` and integrity-checked before transactional DDL. Backup
failure aborts the upgrade; migration failure rolls back the schema and data.
Record/timing bytes, IDs and import receipts are preserved. Current-schema
read-only queries still work while another instance holds a writer reservation.
Backups are retained without automatic pruning.

To roll back:

1. Quit **all** Zigmkay instances.
2. Archive the **entire** current `typing-practice` history directory, including
   any WAL and SHM files. Do not copy only the main active SQLite file.
3. Put the chosen standalone backup in a clean history directory under the name
   `practice.sqlite3`. Do not leave the newer database's WAL/SHM files beside it.
4. Launch the older application that supports the snapshot's schema and payloads.

History recorded after the snapshot remains in your archive and is absent from
the restored database. There is no automatic downgrade or restore UI. The app's
normal **Export database** action also produces a standalone online backup.

## CI and publishing

The [application workflow](../.github/workflows/application-bundle.yml) preserves
the focused Windows diagnostic/GUI modes and builds four native release targets
on PRs and `main`, uploading downloadable packages without publishing. Linux
runtime jobs exercise mounted and extracted AppImages on Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04.
Offline checks relocate packages into paths with spaces/Unicode, deny networking
and system Zig/SDK access, use read-only resources and empty compiler caches, and
build firmware/native runners for all 14 catalog selectors twice. Windows uses
filesystem ACLs and firewall policy in addition to PATH isolation.

Only `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-preview.N` tags are publishable. They must exactly match
`build.zig.zon` and point to a commit belonging to `main`. Source, storage, native
desktop and packaged-runtime jobs run against that commit. Only the final job
has `contents: write`; it waits for all required jobs, validates four downloads
and their metadata/hashes, prepares corresponding sources and `SHA256SUMS`, then
creates a draft, uploads assets and publishes a prerelease. All Actions are pinned
by commit. Failed gates never run publishing. A failed draft upload can be resumed;
a rerun against an already published release refuses to replace its assets.

Run `zig build test-release test-practice-data test-app-paths test-jobs
test-picotool` for focused offline contracts, and `zig build check test` for the
full source suite. Historical SQL/ZON fixtures are committed; generated databases
and packaging outputs belong in caches. Native Windows driver-free flashing and
desktop/device acceptance need a separately requested hardware task.
